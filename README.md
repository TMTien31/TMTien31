# 👋 Hey, I'm Tiến – a builder in the making.

I'm not just learning to write code. I'm learning to build things that matter.

---

## 🧠 What I'm curious about

These days, I spend most of my time diving into:

- 🧬 Building small-yet-efficient LLMs for Vietnamese tasks  
- 🧠 Fine-tuning + evaluation for QA and sentiment analysis  
- 🛠️ Deploying AI with FastAPI, Streamlit, and Hugging Face

But what I care about most?  
**How to turn raw models into real, useful products**.

## 🔭 A few things I've shipped

### 🎓 VSFC Analyzer
Turned a student feedback dataset into a Streamlit app that classifies sentiment & topics in real-time.  
> Designed for educational insights, not just model accuracy.

→ [Live demo](https://github.com/TMTien31/VSFC-Analyzer)

---

### 💉 Biomedical QA Experiments (BioASQ)
Built yes/no and extractive QA pipelines on biomedical texts.  
From fine-tuning PubMedBERT to building custom eval metrics (strict, lenient, MRR).

## 🧭 What I'm building toward

My short-term goal is to become a **solid LLM engineer** who can fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy.  
In the long term, I aim to grow into an **AI Product Architect** — someone who connects models with missions.
