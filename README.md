# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tien.

I'm not just learning to write code. I'm learning to build things that matter.

## ðŸ”­ A few things I've shipped

### ðŸŽ“ VSFC Analyzer
Turned a student feedback dataset into a Streamlit app that classifies sentiment & topics in real-time.  
> Designed for educational insights, not just model accuracy.

â†’ [Live demo](https://github.com/TMTien31/VSFC-Analyzer)

### ðŸ’‰ Biomedical QA Experiments (BioASQ)
Built yes/no and extractive QA pipelines on biomedical texts.  
From fine-tuning PubMedBERT to building custom eval metrics (strict, lenient, MRR).

## ðŸ§­ What I'm building toward

My short-term goal is to become a **solid LLM engineer** who can fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy.  
In the long term, I aim to grow into an **AI Product Architect** â€” someone who connects models with missions.
